I don't generally eat Mexican food because it just isn't on my RADAR.  I lived with an Italian cook for over 15 years who was quite versatile in the kitchen, but occasionally needed or wanted a quick fix that was high in protein and easy to get down.  Burritos, taquitos, tacos... meats and vegetables mixed with a gravy called sofrito were sometimes all he needed.\n","El Super Burrito is on the path of my nightly walks.  Imagine how odd it sounds to go on a healthy walk and stop by a burrito stand!\n","It is a cash only establishment and there is a working cash machine in a small, covered area that has picnic tables.  I have seen workers and families eat here and everyone seems happy.  The window also does an enormous amount of carry out and it advertises its service for catering.\n","I pretty much order the same thing every time I am there.  Two tongue tacos please.  They each come in two-ply, soft, corn tortillas.  I ask them told hold the salsa and cilantro (they wind up giving it to me in a cup) and they add hot fresh corn chips on the side.\n","The food is very good and the service is friendly.  I can order in English or in Spanish and the responses are appropriate and clear.  The pricing is competitive and fair (come on, have you seen how much eggs cost in a store?).  I've also had huevos rancheros and a bean and cheese burrito.  I've never been disappointed.\n","As I had mentioned, there is space to eat out as well as an option take away the meal.  Considering the number of Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood (including the fast food shops such as Taco Bell or Del Taco), I believe that El Super Burrito stands out as an excellent food value for your dollar.\"\"\"\n","\n","comment3 = \"\"\"It use to be my favorite, now it's making a comeback. I love coming here.\n","The food is always great and the service was good.\"\"\"\n","\n","comment4 = \"\"\"My \"home\" course of sorts. It's a nine-hole course that offers some par 4s and even an uphill par 5. It's in decent shape most of the time. Yes, as others have stated, the fairways are patchy and the cart paths have a few potholes. But the greens are surprisingly well-maintained and in great shape.\n","\n","The rates are decent, even with a cart. But they usually run out of carts as this is a popular course due to the price point and ease of booking. You can walk-on, no hassle, and not feel intimidated. This is a public course that anyone can play and have fun on.\n","\n","My only complaint is that the range is meh...the balls are well beaten and in really bad shape. It's pricey to hit a bucket of old balls. Also, no night lights for the range. That's too bad.\"\"\"\n","\n","comment5 = \"\"\"I'm updating my review because the owner has made a great effort to rectify this customers satisfaction and that goes a long way! Food is consistently good here.\n","\n","Tried to call in a phone order for pick up but the girl on the phone said they don't take phone orders that they only accept orders online. So in an effort to save time I order online before I head over. When I get there I asked the cashier if my order is ready and he tells me they are still working on it but they will call my name when it is ready. So I'm sitting and waiting and I'm seeing other people who order after me are getting their orders so I go up and ask them again if my order is ready and apparently it was sitting on the counter for the last 15 minutes. No one called my name to notify me my order was ready and I ordered online and effort to save time. Very displeased with the service I received. My family and I frequent here but this last time was very disappointing\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"ERSJmUKVP88v","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681687697541,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":232,"user":{"displayName":"Xiaoyi Gu","userId":"17899896797067840238"}}},"execution_count":66,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pasadena_case = pd.DataFrame({\n","    \"FACILITY_NAME\":['HALF & HALF TEA HOUSE','EL SUPER BURRITO MEXICAN FAST FOOD RESTAURANT','GIN SUSHI JAPANESE RESTAURANT',\\\n","                     'EATON CANYON GOLF COURSE',\"B-MAN'S TERIYAKI & BURGERS\"],\n","    'name':['Half and Half Tea Express','El Super Burrito','Gin Sushi','Eaton Canyon Golf Course',\"B-Man's Teriyaki & Burgers\"],\n","    'FACILITY_ZIP':['91107', '91107','91107','91107','91107'],\n","    'review_counts':['781','307','1892','72','1040'],\n","    'price':['$$','$$',\"$$\",None,'$$'], \n","    'category':['Coffee & Tea, Juice Bars & Smoothies','Mexican','Sushi Bars, Japanese, Seafood','Golf','Burgers, Fast Food, Japanese'], \n","    'type':['restaurant','restaurant','restaurant','restaurant','restaurant'], \n","    'size':['0-30','0-30','61-150','31-60','31-60'],\n","    'open_hours_week':[49.5, 97,70,91,70], \n","    'SCORE':[97,97,81,81,81], \n","    'score':[3.5,4,3.5,3,4], \n","    'num_photos':['See all 939 photos','See all 295 photos','See all 1797 photos','See all 149 photos','See all 717 photos'], \n","    'is_bus_web':[True, False, True,True,True], \n","    'is_phone_number':[True,True,True,True,True], \n","    'is_message_bus':[False,False,False,False,False],\n","    'num_attributes':[11,21,34, None,26], \n","    'num_questions':['See all 4 questions',None,'See all 7 questions','See all 4 questions','See all 2 questions'], \n","    'comments_list':[comment1,comment2,comment3,comment4,comment5]\n","})"],"metadata":{"id":"HAhQy-qNL5om","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681687699129,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":222,"user":{"displayName":"Xiaoyi Gu","userId":"17899896797067840238"}}},"execution_count":67,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pasadena_case.FACILITY_ZIP[0]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"RWs4bVQNSQFV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681685817072,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Xiaoyi Gu","userId":"17899896797067840238"}},"outputId":"5d64ca25-0072-4286-de14-b522b06764b7"},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'91107'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":48}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pasadena_case.to_csv('use_case.csv', index=False, header=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"smPfuHfCRwQ7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681687701362,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Xiaoyi Gu","userId":"17899896797067840238"}}},"execution_count":68,"outputs":[]}]}
